# Introduction to Azure Repos

Azure Repos is a set of version control tools that you can use to manage your code.

Whether your software project is large or small, using version control is a good idea.

Azure Repos provides two types of version control:

* Git: distributed version control
* Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC): centralized version control


## What do I get with Azure Repos?

* Use of free private Git repositories, pull requests, and code search: Get unlimited private Git repository hosting and support for TFVC that scales from a hobby project to the world’s largest repository.
* Support for any Git client: Securely connect with and push code into your Git repos from any IDE, editor, or Git client.
* Web hooks and API integration: Add validations and extensions from the marketplace or build your own-using web hooks and REST APIs.
* Semantic code search: Quickly find what you are looking for with a code-aware search that understands classes and variables.
* Collab to build better code: Do more effective Git code reviews with threaded discussion and continuous integration for each change. Use forks to promote collaboration with inner source workflows.
* Automation with built-in CI/CD: Set up continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) to trigger builds, tests, and deployments automatically. It with every completed pull request-using Azure Pipelines or your tools.
* Protection of your code quality with branch policies: Keep code quality high by requiring code reviewer sign-out, successful builds, and passing tests before merge pull requests. Customize your branch policies to maintain your team’s high standards.
* Usage of your favorite tools: Use Git and TFVC repositories on Azure Repos with your favorite editor and IDE.


## Introduction to GitHub

GitHub is the largest open-source community in the world. Microsoft owns GitHub. GitHub is a development platform inspired by the way you work.

You can host and review code, manage projects, and build software alongside 40 million developers from open source to business.

GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its features.

While Git is a command-line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface.

It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as wikis and essential task management tools for every project.

So what are the main benefits of using GitHub? Nearly every open-source project uses GitHub to manage its project.

Using GitHub is free if your project is open source and includes a wiki and issue tracker that makes it easy to have more in-depth documentation and get feedback about your project.


## Link GitHub to Azure Boards

Azure Boards has direct integration with Azure Repos, but it can also be integrated with GitHub.

Integrating GitHub with Azure Boards lets you plan and track your work by linking GitHub commits, pull requests, and issues, directly to work items in Boards.

## Azure Boards App

The integration is created by using the Azure Boards App. Acting as a bridge between Azure Boards and GitHub.

To install the app, you must be an administrator or owner of the GitHub repository or the GitHub organization.

The app is installed from the GitHub Marketplace. Azure Boards App


## Authenticating to GitHub

Azure Boards can connect to GitHub. For GitHub in the cloud, when adding a GitHub connection, the authentication options are:

Username/Password
Personal Access Token (PAT)
